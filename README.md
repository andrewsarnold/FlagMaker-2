# FlagMaker 2

FlagMaker 2 is a complete rewrite of the original FlagMaker in Java for cross-platform compatibility.

## How to run

Download a release from the [releases page](https://github.com/andrewsarnold/FlagMaker-2/releases).

### Windows

Run setup.exe, then run the installed FlagMaker. 

### GNU/Linux

You need a Java runtime as well as OpenJFX. The following will install the necessary packages on a Debian-based system:

    apt-get install openjdk-8-jre openjfx

Then unpack the release .zip file to a convenient directory, change to it and run:

    java -jar FlagMaker.jar


### Mac OS X

Instructions are forthcoming. You should be able to run the .jar file as on GNU/Linux. Feel free to document this here and submit a pull request with your documentation.
